## My process

- adding all html elements
- start styling each element until i get to the final result

### Built with

- HTML markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- i learned how to work with flex box and centring a single item in the middle of the screen
  _for example:_

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /*to center items horizontally*/
  align-items: center; /*to center items vertically*/
}
```

### Continued development

when i use css **REM** unit in this challenge everything scaled up i didn't know why.
i guess this is one thing i need to focus on in the future
